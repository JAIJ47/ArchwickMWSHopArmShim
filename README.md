# ArchwickMWSHopArmShim
A shim to prevent the MWS hop up adjustment arm from adjusting the hop up due to recoil (may require a fraction of a mm to be sanded from either of the shorter ends)

On the Archwick L119A2 MWS kit, I've experienced issues with the hop up adjusting itself. When troubleshooting, I noticed that there was a small gap between the upper receiver
wall and the hop up adjustment arm which allowed the adjustment arm to move just enough to adjust the hop up setting when shooting. This shim is to add tension between the
hop arm and the receiver wall so that there is no free movement of the hop setting unless manually set by the user.
